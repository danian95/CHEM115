\section{Course Description}
First course in chemistry for all physical and biological science majors.
Introduces and develops qualitative and quantitative concepts in chemistry
essential for further study in chemistry and application to other science
disciplines. Topics include the elements' atomic and periodic properties,
chemical compound types and properties, chemical reaction types, chemical
stoichiometry, molecular geometry determination and relation to properties,
physical properties of states of matter, qualitative acid-base behavior, and
inter-particle forces. Three hours lecture per week plus three hours per week
laboratory. Successful completion of the course earns 1 GEP toward Goal 3 ---
Analytical and Quantitative Skills and 3 GEPs toward Goal 5 --- Natural
Sciences.


\subsection{Learning Objectives}
We're going to cover a \emph{lot} this semester. You may even wonder if you will
ever use this material in the future. My goal is to not \emph{specifically}
ensure that you have \emph{memorized} all of the material. Rather, you are
expected to be able to:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item Identify the importance of chemicals and chemistry in everyday
		living.
	\item Identify the fundamental concepts of chemistry.
	\item Solve problems using chemical principles and mathematical
		analysis.
	\item Identify the properties of matter and the changes that matter
		undergoes, using logic and chemical principles.
\end{itemize}
Your ability to meet these objectives will be assessed through regular written
evaluations. In preparing for such exams and quizzes, it is therefore imperative
that you understand the \emph{why} and \emph{how} moreso than memorizing the
straight facts covered in the text or examples we try out in lecture.
Approaching the course in this manner will help you develop a skillset
applicable to your specific field of study in the future.

\subsection{Course Community and Communication}
\emph{Your active involvement in the course is important for your success!}
Throughout the semester, I will encourage active participation both during and
outside of lecture. In order to facilitate some community-building, we will be
using the Discussion Boards on BOLT extensively. If you have a question with an
answer that could benefit the class as a whole, please post your question to the
Discussion Board, rather than sending an individual email to directly to me. I
would also be happy to help organize study groups if you are interested. Please
let me know if you would like to chat with other classmates and I will put you
in touch. Learning occurs best when it is driven by your own motivation and
curiosity, not by passively absorbing information I share in a brief 50-minute
period!

All course announcements will be delivered on the BOLT course page. It is your
responsibility to regularly check BOLT. I will \emph{not} send out email
announcements, so BOLT is the \emph{only} location you will need to check for
all important course information --- in my experience, a single location for all
information significantly decreases any confusion. If you would like push
notifications on your phone when announcements are posted, please download the
\href{https://documentation.brightspace.com/EN/brightspace/requirements/all/pulse.htm}{Brightspace
Pulse} app.

\section{Evaluations and Grading}
Unfortunately, we do need to include a metric for assessing your understanding
of the material. This course will be operating on a 100\,\% scale according to
the tables below. 

\begin{multicols}{2}
	\subsection{Point Distribution}
	\begin{tabular} {l r<{\,\%}}
		Exams & 35 \\
		Homework & 10 \\
		Lecture Assignments & 10 \\
		Final Exam & 25 \\
		Laboratory & 20 \\ \midrule
		& 100 \\
	\end{tabular}

	\subsection{Grade Assignment}%
	\begin{tabular} {r@{\,--\,}l<{\,\%} l@{\hspace{0.5in}}r@{\,--\,}l<{\,\%} l}
		\multicolumn{3}{c}{} & 75 & 77 & C+ \\
		91 & 100 & A  & 71 & 74 & C  \\
		88 & 90 & A- & 68 & 70 & C- \\
		\multicolumn{6}{c}{} \\
		85 & 87 & B+ & 65 & 67 & D+ \\
		81 & 84 & B  & 60 & 64 & D  \\
		78 & 80 & B- & 0  & 59 & F
	\end{tabular}
\end{multicols}

\subsection{Graded Items}
\begin{description}
	\item[Exams:] There will be three (3) 50 minute exams held during our
		regularly scheduled lecture time. Tardiness will not extend your
		exam time. If accommodations must be made, it is your
		responsibility to alert the instructor at least 72 hours
		\emph{before} the exam.
	\item[Lecture Assignments:] It is impossible to learn by passively
		absorbing information. Although I will run through examples and
		practice with you, you will work in groups to solve some brief
		assignments regularly. Work will be collected and graded, with
		an emphasis placed on participation and attempts.
	\item[Homework:] There will be regular homework assignments posted to
		LON-CAPA (see the \nameref{homework} section below). You will have sufficient
		opportunities to resubmit answers without penalty before the
		deadline. Make sure to start early so you can come to office
		hours with questions. Essentially, the only reason why you
		should lose points on homework is because you did not turn it in
		on time!
	\item[Laboratory:] Laboratory attendance is mandatory. See the lab
		syllabus for lab policies and specifics on how the labs will be
		graded. Your laboratory grade is determined solely by your
		laboratory instructor. In cases where I (Dr.\ McCurry) am not
		your laboratory instructor, \emph{I will have no ability to
		modify or adjust items graded by your laboratory instructor}.
	\item[Final Exam:] There will be one (1) \emph{comprehensive} 110 minute
		final exam during the final exam week. 
%	\item[Textbook Problems:] Homework problems are designed to help you
%		keep current with the material.  Assigned problems in the
%		textbook will \emph{usually} not be collected, but specific
%		questions may require answer submissions on BOLT (generally 1-2
%		per chapter). Please note that the problems are useful only if
%		you conscientiously work on them.
\end{description}

\subsection{Homework}\label{homework}
This course is using LON-CAPA (\url{https://lon-capa.bloomu.edu}) for homework
assignments. You will be sent an email with your initial username and password.
Unfortunately, it is impossible for me to personally return timely feedback on
homework in addition to grading lab reports, lecture assignments, exams and
materials from other classes. LON-CAPA is able to automatically grade your
answers and will provide you multiple opportunities without penalty to answer
homework questions correctly. This will allow you ample time to seek extra help
if needed. Feel free to work with others (in fact, I encourage it!), but do note
that on most questions, everyone will have different answers.

LON-CAPA may be very different than other homework systems you have used in the
past. All content has been coded and tested by your instructor. If you are
having any issues with any specific problems or the website itself, please reach
out to me as soon as possible. I am using LON-CAPA for its incredible
flexibility in designing problems as well as its cost to students --- free.

\subsection{Grading Errors}
Did I make a mistake? Let me know within 72 hours from the return of the graded
item so that I may re-grade it. \emph{The entire item will be re-graded}. This
timeline is necessary so I don't get a pile of re-grades during the last week of
class. You have until 4:30\,p.m.\ on the day of the final exam to bring clerical
errors (e.g., I typed a grade incorrectly into BOLT) to my attention.

\section{Important Dates}\label{importantdates}
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular} {l l l}
		September 5  & Monday     & Labor Day (No Class) \\
		September 16 & Friday     & Exam 1 \\

	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Please note, if you are unable to take an examination at
its scheduled time due to some unavoidable circumstance, you are obligated to
provide a documented valid excuse to your instructor. \emph{Failure to provide a
valid excuse on these terms will result in a score of zero for the 
exam.}

	Participation in a university-sponsored activity &
	48\,hr in advance of the missed graded event \\
	Military duty & As soon as possible \\
	Religious observance & The second Friday of the semester \\
	Others, as merited on a case-by-case basis & 48\,hr after the
	missed graded event \\
	\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

Immediate technical issues, such as BOLT being inaccessible, can be submitted to
\url{https://helpdesk.bloomu.edu}. At the bottom of the form, you must include
my email address (dmccurry@bloomu.edu) in the ``Additional Email Notifications''
to alert me that you are taking steps to resolve the issue.

\section{Policies and Expectations}
In order to maintain an atmosphere that is conducive to learning, all members
of the class are expected to demonstrate common courtesy during the lecture,
including but not exclusively:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Following university protocol, when necessary, wear a mask
		that covers your nose and mouth.} Not all students are
		vaccinated and other, more infectious variants pose a health
		risk to all individuals. In order to ensure the well-being of
		your fellow classmates, please wear a well-fitting mask while
		inside.
	\item \textbf{Be on time for class.} If you are unavoidably late, enter
		the room quietly and quickly choose a seat.  Tardiness will not
		extend your exam time. We will not return to any missed lecture
		assignments.
	\item \textbf{Once in class, stay for the duration.} If you must leave
		early, give me advance warning. If you become ill during an
		exam, the missed graded event policy will take effect with the
		consent of the professor. In either case, you will not be
		allowed to return that day. Take care of your personal needs
		\emph{before class}.
	\item \textbf{Silence your cell phone and/or other electronic devices.}
		Students with special circumstances need to speak with me right
		away.
	\item \textbf{Refrain from talking to your neighbors excessively.} Stay
		focused on the lecture materials. If you missed something, feel
		free to ask me to repeat it!
\end{enumerate}
\emph{Please review
\href{https://www.bloomu.edu/prp-3881-student-disruptive-behavior-policy}{PRP 3881 Student
Disruptive Behavior Policy} for further details regarding the consequences for
disruptive behavior.}

\subsection{Attendance and Participation}
Physical presence is only part of going to class. Participation in class is
expected. You will be called upon at random and are advised to be prepared.
The best learning occurs in an active environment where everyone participates.
In order to be prepared, you should read the textbook prior to coming to
lecture.  You do not need to understand everything on the first perusal. Many
of your questions will probably be answered by the lecture or as you work the
problems.

\section{Academic Dishonesty}
\emph{Academic dishonesty is not tolerated.} If you are unclear about what is
dishonest, please see 
\href{https://www.bloomu.edu/prp-3512-academic-integrity-policy}{PRP 3512
Academic Integrity Policy} for clarification. All exam work must be your own.
You are permitted to work with others on lecture assignments and homework. Do
note that homework answers are randomized and you will most likely not have the
same answers as your classmates.

\begin{mdframed}
	\centering\bfseries The minimum penalty for academic dishonesty is a
	course assignment of ``F'' for \emph{all} students involved.
\end{mdframed}

\section{Class Cancellation}
If class is canceled on the day of an exam, it will be administered the next
time class meets.  If class is canceled the period before an exam, anticipate
that it will still be administered on its scheduled day. If compression
(see \href{https://www.bloomu.edu/documents/prp5205}{PRP 5205 University Closing
Policy})
occurs on an exam day, the exam will be held as scheduled (with
grading adjusted to allow for the shortened time period).

\section{Fire Alarms}
In the event of a building evacuation, calmly and quickly leave the building via
the nearest exit. In the event of an evacuation during laboratory, ensure all
hot plates or other possible hazards are turned off and unplugged prior to
leaving. Your instructor will point exits out the first week of class.  Gather
with your class on the quad lawn in front of Bakeless. In the case of inclement
weather, we will meet in the Kehr Union Ballroom. Do not re-enter the
building for any reason. Do not gather around the exits. Do not enter a
building that has an alarm sounding. There is one, and only one, drill the first
week of the semester. There are \emph{no} random drills.

%\subsection{From G38}
%\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
%	\item Use the door to the front right of the lecture hall and proceed up
%		the staircase to the exit door.
%	\item Proceed behind Sutliff to the sidewalk near Centennial
%		to the quad traveling in front of McCormick to the mustering
%		point near Bakeless
%\end{enumerate}
%
%Treat fire drills as though they are real, evacuate to the lawn
%in front of Bakeless, and all of us get out of the habit of
%standing anywhere near Hartline Science Center.

\section{Last Day to Withdraw}
The Registrar has set the last day of class as the withdrawal deadline.
Students are encouraged to review the latest withdrawal
(\href{https://www.bloomu.edu/prp-3462-undergraduate-course-withdrawal}{PRP 3462 Undergraduate
Course Withdrawal}) and course repeat
(\href{https://www.bloomu.edu/prp-3452-course-repeat}{PRP 3452 Course
Repeat}) policies of the
University prior to that date as there are strict limits on the number of
repeats one can have. 

Note that withdrawal should be taken as a \emph{last resort}. Your instructor
maintains 5 office hours per week and is willing to meet for additional
appointments to help you succeed in this class. Do not wait until the last minute to seek help.

\section{Accommodations}
Reasonable accommodations may be made to students who have documented
disabilities. If you have a documented disability that requires academic
accommodations and are not registered with
\href{https://bloomu.prod.acquia-sites.com/offices-directory/disability-services}{University
Disability Services}, it is recommended that you contact the Disability Services office during
the \textit{first two weeks of classes} or immediately upon diagnosis to ensure
accommodations are met in an efficient, appropriate, and timely manner.
Note that you must contact the Disability Services office to renew accommodation
letters at the start of each semester. Please also provide documentation to Dr.\
McCurry as promptly as possible.
